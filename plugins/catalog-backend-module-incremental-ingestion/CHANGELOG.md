# @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion

## 0.1.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 98c643a1a2: Introduces incremental entity providers, which are used for streaming very large data sources into the catalog.

### Patch Changes

- de8a975911: Changed to use native `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` from Node.js, instead
  of the one from `node-abort-controller`. This is possible now that the minimum
  supported Node.js version of the project is 16.

  Note that their interfaces are very slightly different, but typically not in a
  way that matters to consumers. If you see any typescript errors as a direct
  result from this, they are compatible with each other in the ways that we
  interact with them, and should be possible to type-cast across without ill
  effects.
